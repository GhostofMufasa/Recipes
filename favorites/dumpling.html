    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      "This is an ode to Dolly Parton," says Rach. "One of her favorite dishes
      is chicken and biscuits." Chicken and dumplings is similar except that
      instead of baking the dough separately, you steam it in the pot with the
      chicken. Just make sure you use a large pan with a lid because you need to
      trap the steam to cook the dumplings. The recipe is super easy and
      tasty—and super satisfying—so give it a try!

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dice tenders into bite size pieces and set aside. Wash hands.</li>
      <li>
        Place a large pot on stove over medium high heat. Add oil, butter,
        vegetables and bay leaf and cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Season
        mixture with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. Add flour to the pan
        and cook 2 minutes. Stir broth or stock to the pot and bring to a boil.

      <li>
        Place biscuit mix in a bowl. Combine with 1/2 cup warm water and
        parsley. Drop tablespoonfuls of prepared mix into the pot, spacing
        dumplings evenly. Cover pot tightly and reduce heat to medium low. Steam
        dumplings 8 to 10 minutes. Remove cover and stir chicken and dumplings
        to thicken sauce a bit. Stir peas into the pan, remove chicken and
        dumplings from heat and serve in shallow bowls.
